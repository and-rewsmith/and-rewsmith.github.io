## Goal

I want a tool to summarize research papers to get a high level overview without investing a lot of time in each paper. This will help me invest time in reading the papers that actually matter.

## SOTA


The state of the art is stuff like this:

I am not a fan. First of all, you need to pay for it, and I feel exploited by that even if it isn't fair. Secondly, the summary it gives you back is not good. I think this can be done a lot better.

## What I want

I want something that segments the text into sections that I can match with the paper. Ideally these would be the numbered sections defined by the paper itself. Then I want a summary to be done for each of these sections with various prompting strategies, self reflection, etc.

Something like this could be done with GPT3.5, and would be cheap. Other people also want this too. A lot of people don't want to "chat with a paper", but they want to use gpt to effectively get a summary. If you search google for "reddit summarize pdf" you will click the first link and see a thread like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/11krppt/best_tools_to_read_and_summarize_pdfs_and/):
> User1: chatpdf.com

> User2: Its great But how do I effectively use prompts to get crisp summary

This is the gap and I am not sure why this doesn't exist.
